= JUnit 4 Demos

These are the demos from Rejminet Group's JUnit 4 course. They may not be much use on their own.

There is no guarantee that they still work, or anything... Use at own risk.

== Setup BEFORE YOU COMPILE

In order to compile, you have to deal with the fact that some of the libraries are not available
in Maven Central.

Copy and pastethis into a terminal or command window:

	mvn install:install-file -Dfile=lib/diasparsoftToolkit-0.24.jar \
		-DgroupId=com.diasporasoft \
		-DartifactId=diasparsoftToolkit \
		-Dversion=0.24.0 \
		-Dpackaging=jar
